## Setup ES6+Babel+JSX Linting with Atom/Nuclide

This sets up Atom to properly lint ES6+Babel+JSX using Airbnb's .eslintrc as a starting point.

## Steps

1. Download [Atom](https://atom.io/) and get these two packages: [Linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter) and [Linter-ESLint](https://atom.io/packages/linter-eslint)
2. Run `npm i -D eslint eslint-config-airbnb babel-eslint eslint-plugin-babel eslint-plugin-react eslint-plugin-react-native eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y` from your project root.
3. Add `"extends": "airbnb"` to your .eslintrc and `"plugins": [ "babel", "react", "react-native", "jsx-a11y" ]`
4. Run `apm install linter-eslint` this also installs `linter` which clashes with nuclide diagnostics
5. Run `apm disable linter` to stop the linter clashing with nuclide

See [Airbnb's Javascript styleguide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) and
the [ESlint config docs](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#extending-configuration-files)
for more information.

## Data Persistence
- [redux-persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) `5.10.0` persist and rehydrate a redux store


## Debugger
- [React Native Debugger](https://github.com/jhen0409/react-native-debugger) : The standalone app based on official debugger of React Native, and includes React Inspector / Redux DevTools
- [redux-devtools-extension](https://github.com/zalmoxisus/redux-devtools-extension) `2.13.5`
